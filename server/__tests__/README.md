# Tests

This directory contains tests for the application. Currently, the tests are not complete.

## Plans

I plan to return to writing tests after completing the front-end development. The tests will cover both unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for routes.

## Tools

The tests will be written using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
